    "# Introduction\n",
    "It is a fact that Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) have been dominant in Copmuter Vision tasks. However, [ViT - AN IMAGE IS WORTH 16X16 WORDS: TRANSFORMERS FOR IMAGE RECOGNITION AT SCALE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929 \"\") paper showed great results compared to SotA models. Here, we will dive deep enough to understand the Transformers architecure and apply the model to some practical tasks."

    "The simplest model consists of two RNNs: one for the encoder and another for the decoder. Encoder reads the source sentence and produces a context vector where all the information about the source sentence is encoded. Then, decoder reads the context vector and generates output sentence based on this vector. The problem with such a model is that encoder tries to compress the whole source sentence into a fixed size vector. This can be hard, especially with long text inputs. It cannot put all information into a single vector without loosing some meaning."

    "Let's take the sentence \"The bank of the river.\" as an example. The word \"bank\" might confuse RNN as it processes the sentence sequentially and does not know whether the \"bank\" represents financial institution or the edge of the river untill the model reaches the end of the sentence. Unlike RNN, Transformer knows the context without reading the whole sentence as it's encoder tokens interact each other and give context to the words. In the above example, it is clear that at each step tokens exchange information and try to understand each other better."
